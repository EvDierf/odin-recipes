# odin-recipes
My take on the 'odin-recipes' assignment, where I make a series of simple web pages

My first real assignment with **The Odin Project**.  A simple website displaying three recipes and a main page.  This will showcase what I have learned so far:

- Writing an HTML boilerplate file
- Basic HTML as a foundation 
	+ Headers
	+ Paragraphs
	+ List, both ordered and unordered
	+ Elements
- Basic use and positioning of images
- Using links

This is done using only the tools I have been shown for the moment.
